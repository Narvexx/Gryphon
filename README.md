Gryphon implements a symbolic model checking approach for model-driven software systems whose static structure is defined by models built with the Eclipse Modeling Framework [1] and whose behavior is defined by graph transformation built with the Henshin API [2]. Gryphon can verify safety properties of the form AG phi or reachability properties of the form EF phi.
